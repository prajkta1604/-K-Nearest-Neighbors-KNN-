# -K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
This repository contains an implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. KNN works by finding the K closest data points to a given input and making predictions based on majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
